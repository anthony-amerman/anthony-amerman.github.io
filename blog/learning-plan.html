    <h2>LEARNING PLAN</h2>

    <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>
      As far as coding goes, I would like to have a job that is stimulating and that I can eventually work remote and/or freelance. I'd also like to use coding in conjunction with music somehow, whether that ends up being a main job or something to do for my own enjoyment. Because there are so many directions someone can go in with coding, I'd like to have the skills and know how to better continue teaching myself after this course ends.
    </p>
    <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning:</h3>
    <h4>Strengths:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>i pick things up quickly</li>
      <li>i learn through watching and doing</li>
      <li>i enjoy problem solving</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>i can have trouble focusing at times</li>
      <li>i procrastinate sometimes</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
    <p>
      I'd like to get better at time management and self-directed learning
    </p>
    <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</h3>
    <p>
      I will stay on task, respect other people's time and space, listen to people's needs, including my own, take care of myself, and check in with others when appropriate.
    </p>
    <h3>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h3>
    <p>
      I think I do ok dealing with this in general already but its always a good idea to take a breathe and a step back to reassess things. I could stand to internalize negative feelings less often
    </p>
    <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
    <p>
      I will try to solve things in different ways on my own first, which includes searching online resources. If I need outside help I will do my best to recognise this and ask for it in a timely, respectful and clear manner.</p>
    <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
    <p>
      I expect respect, guidance, and help when we need it
    </p>
    <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
    <p>
      I don't have any commitments that will conflict with the course. If any pop up I will keep this in mind.
