      <h2>IDENTITY VALUES</h2>
      <p>I'd like to talk a bit about the DIY music community I've been involved with for years in regards to culture and both personal and community ethics. DIY stands for "do it yourself" with an emphasis on self-initiative over monetary or promotional support from large record labels, venues or radio/streaming services. At the same time it also carries with it an ethos of Do It Together where self-initiative is important, but it is also good and necessary to rely on and help each other. It is a marriage of self reliance and community.</p>
      <p>whether organizing, playing, or attending a show there are a number of ethical things to consider:</p> 
	    <ul>
        <li>which type of venue will this be at? a house or community center is usually ideal because any funds raised do not need to be shared with a business like a bar or club and you can set your own rules, but this isn't always possible.you still need to consider things like access. will people with disabilities be comfortable? do we want this to be an all-ages show? will all types of people feel safe?</li>
        <li>what types of acts will be performing? where is the line between holding high artistic standards and being supportive of your friends or people that are just starting out? how an we include more people from diverse backgrounds while avoiding tokenizing? is this a bill of popular bands that will bring a lot of people out but that get to play a ton? can that be balanced with acts that don't play as often or might offer somthing different and unexpected?</li>
        <li>how do we handle money? DIY has a general disdain for moneyed interests and its primary reasons for supporting and making art and music are not capital, but it is still important to compensate artists, keep them and DIY venues afloat, and show appreciation. people within DIY will support artists they like and promote each others shows. for example, maybe buying an album instead of streaming it or handing out flyers or posting on social media. the cost to attend a gig is usually small, maybe ten dollars or free, and usually strongly encouraged rather than demanded. you might often find a bowl of money being passed around with a strong honesty policy in place. that takes an amount of mutual trust and respect.if a touring act is coming through, locals help by setting up and bringing people out to the shows and sometimes offering a free place to stay, with the understanding that the same hospitality would be extended when they tour.sometimes shows will be organized as fundraisers or charities, with bands donating any earnings.</li>
        <li>there are strong sentiments in DIY about being supportive and kind to one another and just generally not being a jerk and ruining it for others. we care about other people and we want people to feel safe, welcome, comfortable, encouraged. that being said, there's alway the risk of things not happening this way. the responibility to sort of self-govern and address issues when they pop-up, then, rests on every member of the community. what can be done to prevent problems like harm or harrassment from arising? say someone is causing problems, is this a good person who has made a mistake or had a bad day and can be "called in"? or is this someone who is likely to continue being toxic or harming others?</li>
        <li>in a self-sustaining and alternative community, there may not be a blueprint or previously designed set of rules for organizing things or solving problems. all these things and more have to be thought about critically, with intent, and with consideration to ethics.the easy way to do things is often not the right way to do things</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some of my strengths are the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I care very much about people and consider myself rather empathetic</li>
        <li>I'm a quick learner and good at thinking both logically and more abstractly</li>
        <li>I'm creative</li>
        <li>I enjoy helping people and try to meet them where they are at in a non-judgemental way.</li>
        <li>I like to problem solve</li>
        <li>I'm good at admitting and apologizing when I know I'm wrong and asking for help when I need help.</li>
        <li>I appreciate constructive criticism, even when it stings</li>
      </ul> 


      <p>Some weaknesses:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I get distracted quite easily and have trouble focusing, until I finally achieve focus or get in a zone, then i can stay hyper focused for hours</li>
          <li>I try not to be judgmental but i have a hard time if i think someone or something is full of baloney or disingenuos</li>
          <li>I can be quite blunt and direct (not mean, i don't think), which I think is good in many situations but I know sometimes can be jarring or give an intense impression to others.</li>
          <li>I've gotten better at remembering not everyone likes to debate, but I can become argumentative. (I like to argue, but I hate to fight)</li>
          </ul>
