    <h2>CORE REFLECTION</h2>
    <p>
      What surprised me the most about learning core was how helpful it was to revsit concepts i had been previously familiar with. It is one thing to go yeah, yeah i know what self-care and growth mindset stuff is and maybe some of it seems a little silly or overly earnest for my irony-sick brain, but then to actually take whichever or all concepts and methods fom core seriously for a few moments and to sit with it before my day or before i begin again after a break, can be quite helpful. tasks become easier, i feel more calm.
