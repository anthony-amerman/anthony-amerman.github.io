      <h3>NEUROPLASTICITY</h3>
      <h4>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h4>
      <p>Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity enables us to better approach things like teaching and learning, disorders and disabilities, mental health. it benefits both the instructor or caregiver, and the person receiving care or instruction. similar to how knowing how muscles work helps to build physical strength or burn fat, knowing how the brain works helps to build mental strength or change poor habits.</p>
      <h4>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h4>
      <p>For my own benefit I will remind myself that doing hard things, like learning unfamiliar coding or staying focused, and avoiding bad habits, like procrastinating or smoking, is a form of mental workout. The more they are practiced, the stronger those mental connections and the easier the hard tasks will become.</p>
      <h4>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h4>
      <p>Practice, practice, but also take rests to allow yourself to recharge. With practice, intent is very important. you need to be speciic in targeting areas you want to improve. pay special attention to the things you find hard, but want to be better at. that being said, i think at times it's also good to know your current limitations and use the strengths you do have to your advantage. </p>
      <p><a target ="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88OL8NdkV-s" ><b><u>HERE</u></b></a> is a link to a lay-scientific explanation of neuroplasticity and how it relates to learning</p>
      <h3>GROWTH MINDSET</h3>
      <h4>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h4>
      <p>Growth mindset is the belief and attitude that a person can learn and grow through time and practice as opposed to a Fixed mindset which leans more toward the idea that talents and limitations are innate and unchangeable. People that posess or are taught to hold a growth mindset, tend to learn things more quickly and have more confidence approaching challenges or problems outside of their current skillsets. </p>
      <h4>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h4>
      <p>these are concepts i was already familiar with but it's been worth remembering them and thinkng about how i can put it into practice more consistently. i tend to bounce between fixed and growth mindsets for things. i've realized the more i approach a broad area of interest or type of learning with a growth mindset, the easier a growth mindset comes to me the next time i'm doing a similar thing. for example, i've played different types of instruments and experimented with sounds so many times that a new instrument does not intimidate me, even if i've never tried to play it before.
      </p>
      <h4>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h4>
      <p>For myself I think it will be helpful to approach any challenges with a can do attitude and not give up when something is hard. When I tell myself even quietly that i can't do something, or that i am predisposed to be bad at something, my confidence is shot. I also need to remind myself that a challenge is not best though of as a test to prove or defend my intelligence but rather an opportunity to pratice and try and, whether failing or succeeding, to learn something either way. people need to suck at most things before they get good at them. have you ever seen a baby try to walk? and if someone does have a natural gift for something they enjoy, it would be a shame not to nurture that to its fullest.</p>
      <p>i think <a target ="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUWn_TJTrnU" ><b><u>THIS</u></b></a> video <em>illustrates</em> growth mindest quite nicely.</p>
      <h4>BLEND WITH YOUR LEARNING PLAN</h4>
      <h3>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h3>
      <p>i think i've laid this out pretty well in the two similar prompts above but i will add that i will try not to worry about looking stupid and to work smart and efficiently but take the challenging route if it can be a learning experience. also, if i can avoid something like procrastinating, it may subsequently become easier each time i have periods of focus, and in this way i imagine i will feel more in control of myself.</p>
