    <h2>FOUNDATIONS REFLECTION</h2>
    <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
    <p>
      I've learned I can get better at the things I struggle at, If I do something difficult, it will be easier the next time, and that I am sometimes too hard on myself.
    </p>
    <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
    <p>
      Well, your personal values wouldn't be very strong if they disappeared under certain contexts, so it's important to remember to bring your own values into any work you do. Empathy is important in coding because you're going to be working with other people and also making things that other people are going to engage with. Website accessibility, for example, is going to be easier to accomplish if you can imagine where people with disabilities are coming from. And you'll be working more efficiently and with less stress if everyone gets along and communicates and respects each other. Self-awareness is important in coding both in thinking about how you are acting towards others and for being able to check in with yourself, recognizing whe you feel stressed or need help, remembering to breathe and take breaks, take a step back and reassess, general self-care.
    </p>
    <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
    <p>
      I dunno if it was a surprise but I felt like I applied myself more and had more confidence after considering growth mindset. It was nice to feel it working and helped dispel feelings of overwhelmth and self-doubt.
    </p>
    <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
    <p>
      I've found it hard not to feel silly posting core blogs to be honest. The core stuff is helpful to think about internally and talk about with other people, it just feels weird to post about it for assessment. I also wasn't sure how formal to make the blog posts and reflection answers. I went with casual/informal.
    </p>
    <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
    <p>
      Dev Academy has been pretty clear that it's because people skills make a person more employable, no one is going to want to work with or hire you if you're hard to get a long with or dont know how to communicate. This makes sense to me and I appreciate it.
    </p>
    <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
    <p>
      I didn't feel like it took up that much time and it was a nice thing to do at the start of the week before diving in to the harder programming stuff. Ocassionally the reflection and blog prompt questions felt a little unnecessarily repetetive or redundant, like I was answering the same questions from a previous week with different wording, or blogging from prompts that I felt like I had already gone over in reflections. I would have appreciated a little more programming over core just because coming in I felt like my core skills were already pretty solid while my coding skills were at zero. But each student is different and refreshers or different persepctive on core stuff is helpful. Overall the core sections were helpful.
