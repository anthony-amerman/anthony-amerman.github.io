    <h2>PROBLEM SOLVING</h2>

    <h3>Times I Ran Into Problems</h3>
    <p> 
      I can't think of any specific examples that are at all interesting, so as an alternative solution to this problem (ahummm?? ðŸ˜‰ ). I'd like to talk about a couple general things I've learned about problem solving in life:
    </p> 
    <p>
      It's important to approach problems from different angles, with different techniques, often times with different people. Sometimes takng a break, and returning later will grant you renewed energy and a fresh perspective. its also important, i think, after you've exhausted every option, and depending on the situation, to know when to accept failure or inability, learn form it and move on. that way you can use your energy to solve other problems or grow in the areas 
    </p>

    <h3>Problem Solving Techniques</h3>
    <p>
      Pseudocode: I certainly know what this is and feel fairly confident I <em>could</em> use it, but I should practice it more. In the repl exercises this sprint I found the parts were small enough that it was helpful enough to kind of pseudocode in my head. Also when I felt stuck, the hints were already full of rather useful pseudocode.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trying something: I think this i a great way to approach things, especially in coding where it's quite easy to 'undo' anything that doesn't work. A lot of times, if you think you're on to something, you are, and if it doesn't work you might gain further info from error messages or console.logging.(see below)
    </p>
    <p>
      Rubber ducky method: I talk to myself a lot. Long shower arguments or whisper debates when i'm trying to fall asleep. It helps to talk out your problems or ideas point-by-point and sometimes just hearing ourselves say it is enough to find a solution or strengthen our ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reading error messages: Great, especially if it's a big long thing, it can tell you where to focus. which line, what value, etc. it's oftentimes even just a typo or forgotten bracket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Console.logging: another way to periodically test what you're working on, I like console.logging because it can work in tandem with an error message and you can see a little bit more under the hood. If a function isn't working properly, for example the error message will point you to the function, or the values, or tell you a little about them, while if you console.log that function you can see what it actually spits out, possibly giving you a better idea of what you've done wrong. You can also run it just to confirm you're getting what you want/expect out of the code you're working on/
    </p>
    <p>
      Googling: i prefer duckduckgo
    </p>
    <p>
      Asking your peers for help: I think this is great becausse not only are thes people that may have solved the same problem you ar currently dealing with, it helps people solidify their understanding of something if they can fully explain it to someone else. not to mention it can clear up room for the tougher questions for the facillitators.
    </p>
    <p>
      Asking coaches for help: the experts, that's what they're there for. it's good to help each other learn, but sometimes you need extra guidance or knowledge on stuff. I really could stand to ask for more help from everyone in general. It feels good to solve things "on my own", but after a certain amount of time, I'd be doing myself a disservice by not asking for help.
    </p>
    <p>
      Improving your process with reflection: I think the reflection exercises we've been doing during foundations have been a good help. I like to reflect when I cook a meal. What things were successful? If parts or the entire thing were unsuccessful, what did I do wrong, or what could I add or do better next time? Even if I'm happy with it, there's always room for improvement or expansion to something more advanced. I'd like to continue carrying this technique into future coding and code learning.
